## Projects

### 1. [Online Gift Store](https://github.com/Informatics-370/370development-team-18-let-s-get-personal)
**Description**: As part of my bachelor thesis, I worked on developing an online gift store for a company,
allowing customers to upload personalized designs and have them manufactured on a
variety of selected products (e.g., mugs, t-shirts, etc.). This project provided a seamless,
user-friendly experience for customers to personalize and preview their designs in
real-time before placing an order.
