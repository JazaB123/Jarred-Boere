**Description**: As part of my bachelor thesis, I worked on developing an online gift store for a company,
allowing customers to upload personalized designs and have them manufactured on a
variety of selected products (e.g., mugs, t-shirts, etc.). This project provided a seamless,
user-friendly experience for customers to personalize and preview their designs in
real-time before placing an order.

### 3. [Event Management System](https://github.com/JazaB123/EventManagementSystem.git)
**Description**: This project is an Event Management System built with C Sharp, designed to manage events by allowing users to create, update, and view event details. It features a console-based interface where users can update event information such as name, description, date, and location. The system validates inputs, ensures data integrity, and allows users to modify event details while maintaining a clean and user-friendly flow. The project uses essential C# concepts like object-oriented programming, nullable types, and exception handling to ensure a robust and efficient event management process.
